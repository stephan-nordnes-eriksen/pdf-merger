# PDF Merger
Simple Cross platform PDF merger gui. Should work on most platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

Drag-n-drop PDF files to merge them into one. Drop multiple files into the the `instant merge.` to immediately merge all the dropped PDF-files. Drop one or more PDF files into the `collection merge.` to make a collection. Drop more files until you have collected all, and finally click "merge" to merge all the files in the order that they were dropped in.
