# pdf-merger
Simple Cross platform PDF merger gui. Should work on most platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

Drag-n-drop pdf-files to merge them into one. Drop multiple files into the the `Instant Merge.` to immediately merge all the dropped PDF-files. Drop one or more PDFs into the collection merge to make a collection. Repeat the process, and finally click "merge" to merge all the files in the order that they were dropped in.
